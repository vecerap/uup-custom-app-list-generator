# Accepted changes:

I will only accept bug fixing or feature improvements of the script (though I do not know how to more over-engineer simple script with additional features). 

Default selected apps in array should be only the smallest set of required apps to run Windows without bigger problems and have it still debloated. Accepted changes are change of the package names already included, or an addition of new package which is not bloatware.

# PR format

**I will not accept individual modifications without proper explanation described in PR** and those PR will be closed

Keep branches with trunk-based development workflow. Violations will not be accepted with PRs.
